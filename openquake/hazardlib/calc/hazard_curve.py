    Compute hazard curves on a list of sites, given a set of seismic sources
    and a set of ground shaking intensity models (one per tectonic region type
    considered in the seismic sources).


    Probability of ground motion exceedance is computed using the following
    formula ::

        P(X≥x|T) = 1 - ∏ ∏ Prup_ij(X<x|T)

    where ``P(X≥x|T)`` is the probability that the ground motion parameter
    ``X`` is exceeding level ``x`` one or more times in a time span ``T``, and
    ``Prup_ij(X<x|T)`` is the probability that the j-th rupture of the i-th
    source is not producing any ground motion exceedance in time span ``T``.
    The first product ``∏`` is done over sources, while the second one is done
    over ruptures in a source.

    The above formula computes the probability of having at least one ground
    motion exceedance in a time span as 1 minus the probability that none of
    the ruptures in none of the sources is causing a ground motion exceedance
    in the same time span. The basic assumption is that seismic sources are
    independent, and ruptures in a seismic source are also independent.

        of :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.source.base.BaseSeismicSource`).
