# OpenQuake Hazardlib

![OpenQuake Logo](https://www.globalquakemodel.org/media/storage/oq-logo.png)

The OpenQuake Hazard Library is open-source software for performing seismic hazard analysis.

## About

hazardlib includes modules for modeling seismic sources (point, area and fault), earthquake ruptures, temporal (e.g. Poissonian) and magnitude occurrence models (e.g. Gutenberg-Richter), magnitude/area scaling relationships, ground motion and intensity prediction equations (i.e. GMPEs and IPEs).
Eventually it will offer a number of calculators for hazard curves, stochastic event sets, ground motion fields and disaggregation histograms.

hazardlib aims at becoming an open and comprehensive tool for seismic hazard analysis. The [GEM Foundation](http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) supports
the development of the  library by adding the most recent methodologies
adopted by the seismological/seismic hazard communities. Comments,
suggestions and criticisms from the community are always very welcome.
